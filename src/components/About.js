            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Bryce Landers, I am a self taught Blockchain Developer who is passtionate
                about all things web3. I am a pioneer at heart, and see Blockchain as an inevitable path
                to the future and solution to almost all problems we currently face.     
            </p>&nbsp;
             <p>
                Blockchain development to me is so much more than computer code but a creative expression which is ever changing. 
                Getting introduced to NFTs in late summer of 2021, I found Blockchain development out of safety because this was
                was the last career I saw myself in. I wanted to be able to protect myself from scams and backdoors by being able 
                to read smart contracts but found everything I didnt know I was looking for. 
            </p>&nbsp;
            <p>
                I found the oppurtunity to have life long mastery in an industry which never stays stagnant. The ability
                to solve complex problems for a complex world. The platform to bring any idea to life if you can conceieve it. 
                To me Blockchain development is a blank canvas to create with and truly enjoy the process along the way.
